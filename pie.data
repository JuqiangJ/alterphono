# This file contains data for the generation of matrixes for phylogenetic
# analysis of Proto-Indo-European; the data express the phonetic value
# of corresponding phonemes in cognates. For more information, contact me.
# This file works as a CSV file, but in most systems you will need to strip
# comments and blank lines; in R, can be read directly when the appropriate
# arguments of read.table() are set. While the matrix here presented could
# be used directly (possibly inverting rows and columns), it is intended for
# the generation of secondary matrices (such as expression of changes by
# means of binary features after Chomsky & Halle).

# Columns represent the expression of a given phoneme context in
# Sanskrit, Avestan, Old Church Slavonic, Lithuanian, Armenian, Albanian,
# Tocharian A, Hittite, Ancient Greek, Latin, Old Irish and Gothic. Each line
# corresponds to a given context, explained in the comments.

# PIE context 1: amlaut /p/
# notes: the expression for Hittite is simplified, as it is /p/ only for
#        word initial position, and not every amlaut; in Gothic, the phoneme
#        is usually expressed as /f/, being /θ/ only when in amlaut or
#        directly after stress.

# PIE context 2: V + /p/
# notes: in Hittite, it is /p/ (as below) only when intervocal; on Gothic,
#        the evolution is complex and may require new contexts.

# PIE context 6: initial /t/, not followed by e/eː/i/iː
# notes: check the actual phoneme for Armenian, here given palatalized (which
#        is probably wrong); on Gothic, this context is similar to context #2
#        and probably also requires the development of new contexts.
